######Required Software to execute the codes herein#####
#Note: this assumes you are working in a linux or other unix environment
#and already have bash installed on a terminal. There is a sample 
#bash_aliases file that will ensure that everything gets called correctly.
#This file should be copied into your home directory and be modified as necessary
#if the path to each program is different in your filesystem (this may be true for 
#SURF/VASP). VMD and python should be ok but check anyways to be sure. To check for
#an alias file try: ls ~/.bash_aliases    if nothing comes up then you don't have
#one and need to create one (NOTE: it must begin with a period '.'). After modifying/
#creating an alias file type into your terminal: source ~/.bashrc

###fpocket 3.04
#note: it is CRITICAL that you download fpocket 3.04 from github or it will find all
#sorts of incorrect pockets with bad numbering of STP atoms. to do so on linux go to
#https://github.com/Discngine/fpocket and follow the directions to install from github
#an error we noticed is that some distros of linux are lacking the netcdf library for C

###surfView/Wine
#surfView.exe is on the Brian Chen lab website
#wine is missing glut32.dll libraries on fresh install
#download winetricks from github:
#wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Winetricks/winetricks/master/src/winetricks
#and make it executable: chmod +x winetricks
#run it, following menus to install glut library
#surfView can not be run through wine on linux

###SURF/VASP
#out of the box VASP and SURF will not compile
#due to errors in the code on the Brian Chen
#lab website. the makefile in both are the culprit.

#for SURF the following lines should look like:

#CC = gcc
#CXX = g++
#CPPFLAGS = -g -pedantic -Wall -Wno-deprecated -Wparentheses
#CFLAGS = -g

#for VASP:

#CC = gcc -m64
#CXX = g++ -m64
#CPPFLAGS = -g -pedantic -pedantic-errors -Wall -Wno-depecrated
#CFLAGS = -g -fPIC

###VMD
#located on ks.uiuc website just download the latest stable release
#for linux.

###Python 3 + packages
#make sure you have python 3.5 or newer installed NOT 2.7 or 3.4
#there are several python packages that you may or may not already
#have installed. it is recommended to use a python installation
#such as anaconda to cover your bases but if you have a minimal installation
#the following packages must be installed: biopython, urllib3, itertools,
#numpy, scipy
#To install python packages use: pip -install packegename
