###Starting structure is Nitrogenase MoFe 1m1n.pdb
###The initial structure is a homo-4mer and has been reduced
###to chain C for pocket search in nitrogenase.pdb
###using atomselections in the TK console of VMD

###Pocket 1 from fpocket is site of FeMoCo with a small piece
###of homocitrate poking into pocket 14


###Workflow is as follows

###run setup.py in order to populate the initial_structures directory with
###the target pocket and its subsequent rotations

###acquire master pdb list from RCSB and name pdb_list.txt. put
###in the sublist directory before running sublist.py. if you want
###to changed the number of structures per sublist there is a variable,
###n, in the sublist script that can be changed.

###run the search-for-pockets bash script which will do all the heavy lifting
###details of the scripts it calls are located inside the script file and more
###detailed descriptions can be found in the README file in the scripts directory

###pose files get outputted to the rosetta directory

###pdb candidates that pass the first fpocket filter will be located in the winners
###directory. each subdirectory will contain only 100 structures and there is an
###additional directory called scorefiles which will contain the score of each run
###these directories are not correlated by number in any way so they may be difficult
###to navigate
