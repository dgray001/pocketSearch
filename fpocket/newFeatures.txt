- fixed issues with ugly pdbs and weird coordinates in infinite space

new Features since last release :
- new clustering approach based on clusterlib, allowing to use typical hierarchical clustering of alpha spheres
- possibility of denoising pocket detection by replicating Voronoi vertice detection on slightly shifted coordinates
- the user can now specify its own grid and its own grid dimensions for mdpocket calculations directly in the mdpocket input file
- we start to introduce some energy calculation functionalities into the code, so atom typing and charge assignment for protein atoms with the aim to calculate pocket energy maps
 the molfile plugin of VMD is now integrated allowing to analyse easily a large variety of molecular formats (especially useful for MD trajectories here)
- new look of fpocket input
- dpocket can now be run on cases where the ligand is designated as a chain, particularly useful for polysaccharide and peptide binding site characterization
- new pocket descriptors : 
	- number of abpas
	- apolar & polar vdw surface areas at 1.4 - 2.2 A probe radii
	- convex hull volume
- pocket energy grid calculations using topologies

corrected bugs and code improvements : 
- memory accumulating in mdpocket, dpocket and tpocket and fpocket -L now cleaned up
- compiling issues on newer GCC's on Ubuntu have been solved
- code clean up from things not used anymore
- errors in descriptor output for amino acid based descriptors have been corrected


new dependencies :
- libnetcdf,libstdc++
