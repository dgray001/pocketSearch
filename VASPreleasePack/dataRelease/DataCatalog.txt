This data set contains the data necessary to reproduce work described in the 
article "VASP-E: Specificity Annotation with a Volumetric Analysis of 
Electrostatic Isopotentials".  The data provided as part of this release are 
in the public domain, but as these data originate from the Protein Data Bank 
(PDB), it is expected that the originators of these data, of the PDB, VASP, 
and VASP-E be properly cited whenever their work is referred to.  

The data set includes protonated PDB structures of the data used in the paper,
so that those attempting to reproduce the work avoid issues with structures 
protonated differently.

./protonatedStructures/cysteineProteases
./protonatedStructures/serineProteases
./protonatedStructures/barnaseBarstar
./protonatedStructures/rap1aRaf

The data set also includes .SURF files describing the union of spheres used 
to define the boundaries of ligand binding cavities.  These spheres are used 
in the method described in "VASP: A Volumetric Analysis of Surface Properties 
Yields Insights into Protein-Ligand Binding Specificity" for defining 
cavities.  Each sphere is centered on the position of a ligand atom. Using 
these spheres, in combination with .SURF files that represent
the molecular surface and envelope surfaces, you can generate serine protease
and cysteine protease binding cavities at arbitrary resolutions, following the
method from the paper and the vasp software, available with the VASP-E paper.

Use your favorite software for generating molecular surfaces to produce the 
molecular and envelope surfaces.  A file format is described in SURFformat.txt.

Finally, the data set also includes .SURF files describing the spheres used to 
represent the interface region within the two protein complexes used in the 
dataset.  You can use these and the provided tools to reproduce the nullification
analysis individual amino acids in protein-protein interactions.
