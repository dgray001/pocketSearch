////generateSURF:  This function generates a SURF file based on a surfaceObject and a set of
////                  point indices that reference a patch on the surface.  The output is a
////                  SURF file that contains only the points relevant to render the patch.
////                  If the set of points is NULL, the entire surface is returned.
////

////                    OUTPUT FORMAT:  A SURF file 
////                       -Anywhere in the file, empty lines and line starting with '#' are
////                       considered comments, and are ignored.
////                       -File has 2 sections: geometry and topology
////                  
////                       The geometry section is always first, and starts with:
////                       GEOMETRY: <int>
////                       where <int> is the number of points to be specified.
////                       then there are <int> lines as follows:
////                       <float> <float> <float> <float> <float> <float>
////                       which stand for x,y,z, and xnormal, ynormal, znormal.
////                  
////                       The topology section is always second, and starts with:
////                       TOPOLOGY: <int>
////                       where <int> specifies the number of triangles on the surface
////                       Then there are <int> lines as follows:
////                       <int> <int> <int>
////                       Each int stands for the 3 corners of the triangle
////                       and is an index into the array of points provided in the
////                       Geometry section.  I.e. the geometry section is indexed
////                       starting at zero, and ending at (size-1).
