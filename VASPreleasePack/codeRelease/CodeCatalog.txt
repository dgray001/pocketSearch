Compilation:

The software below are provided in three folders: 

./surfProcessing/
./vasp/
./scripts/

To compile the code, change your working directory to one of these folders 
and type "make".  The executable binary will be generated in the "debug" folder.
Object files are generated in the "object" folder.  Source code is in the
"source" folder.  The final directory contains perl and python scripts, which
do not require compilation.


File Format:

In addition to PDB file formats, the software provided also operates on closed
surfaces of triangles described by .SURF files.  The .SURF file format is very
simple, and a concise description of the format is provided in here:

SURFformat.txt



To operate surfProcessing and vasp, please read the following files which
explain how to use this code.

./surfProcessing/README-surfProcessing.txt
./vasp/README-vasp.txt
./genCustomCRG/README-scripts.txt
