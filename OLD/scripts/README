#
##setup.py
#
#sets the initial structures up based on some user inputs to get surfaces
#of rotations and volume text file
#
##sublist.py
#
#breaks up the master pdb list into smaller sublists
#
##get-pdbs.py
#
#downloads a set of pdbs given by a designated sublist.txt file
#
##pick-random-pdbs.py
#
#script that uses a random number generator to choose 100 pdbs from the 
#master list from rcsb
#
##gen-pockets
#
#bash script that iteratively runs fpocket over the whole PDB directory
#and then finds which entries don't have pockets and deletes their output
#directory. finally cleanup-pdbs.py is called to remove the pdbs whose
#outputs were deleted
#
##pocket-finder.py
#
#detects pockets in the pdb file output of fpocket
#excises them based on a size filter (number of pocket points)
#able to sort out multiple pockets from a single input
#
##center.tcl
#
#recenters a pocket so that VASP analysis can be accurately done
#
##align-structures.py
#
#finds the longest axis in each pocket, passes this to align.tcl
#
##align.tcl
#
#does alignments for each pocket along the longest axis
#
##compare.py
#
#script that runs surf/vasp for each combo against the original
#nitrogenase pocket. outputs scores to text file
#
##get-score-file.py
#
#integrates all scores into one file, also integrates scorefile into a master
#scorefile that tracks all structures analysis has been performed on
#
##rosetta-prep.py
#
#generates a pose file for each passable structure meeting filter reqs
#
##move-good-pdbs.py
#
#puts all the pdbs captured by this code into respective winners subdirectories
#and additionally the scorefiles into a scorefiles subdirectory, prepares for a
#clean run of the code
