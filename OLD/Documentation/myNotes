fpocket on original pdb

setup.py
creates conformations of target (1m1n.pdb) pocket
need to already have run fpocket and decided what pocket you want (the one with FeMoCo i.e.)

pick-random-pdbs.py
takes 100 random lines from sublists/pdb_lists.txt
downloads the pdb => 



search-for-pockets
	so-called master command file

prepare-pdbs.py
runs a script called clean_pdb.py which comes from Rosetta (tools/protein_tools/scripts)

gen-pockets
runs fpocket on all our pdbs from rcbi
output = pdb with pockets + original atoms

pocket-finder.py
cuts out pockets of appropriate size and puts them in new pdb file
minimum cutoff already applied in fpocket here apply maximum cutoff

align-structures.py
centers and aligns the pockets from pocket-finder.py

compare.py
VASP on each conformation of each aligned structure from align-structures.py
outputs is intersect volume and the original pocket volume

get-score-file.py
generates score file and appends to master score file

rosetta-prep.py
goes through score file and generates pose file (for Rosetta) from pdb file with AA residues (from fpocket) for any pockets that have 1+ hits & >=0.7% intersect volume

move-good-pdbs.py
housekeeping


.tcl
vmd scripts
measure-sasa.tcl
maybe align instead of to longest distance to cavity opening
